/* Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation. */

/* Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]

/* The trick with this one, as is the case with many array-based problems, is to find a key insight about how the math works out at each position.

Consider the example input: [1,2,3,4]

And its output: [24,12,8,6]

Let's ignore the first index, since it'll end up being a special case. Look at input[1], which has a value of 2. The output we want is 12, which we can get with 1 * 3 * 4, all the elements except 2.

The key insight is that it's not just 1 * 3 * 4 that we want, but rather, we want product of all left elements * product of all right elements, which in this case is (1) * (3 * 4). If, for every index in the input array, we knew the product of all elements to its left, and the product of all elements to its right, we could determine the product of the array except itself - without having to use a division operation, as the problem asked us to.

Let's talk about the straightforward way to approach this, and then we can dig into the optimized space solution afterwards

Building Prefix and Suffix Arrays
We can solve this problem in linear time and space with three passes:

On the first pass, iterate through the array and create an array of prefixes, which give us the product of all left elements for each position
On the second pass, iterate through the array and create an array of suffixes, which give us the product of all right elements for each position
On the third pass, build a result array that contains the product of prefixes[i] * suffixes[i] for each position, and return this as our answer.
There are two special cases to consider:

The prefix value of the first element in the array should just be 1, since there are no values to the left of it.
The suffix value of the last element in the array should just be 1, since there are no values to the right of it.
Here's how we can express that in JavaScript: */

var productExceptSelf = function(nums) {
 // First, create a prefix array that moves from the left,
    // gathering the running product of the prefix at each index
    const prefix = []
    
    // Move left in the input array
    for (let i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
        // If i === 0, start with `1`, since there is no prefix
        if (i===0) {
            prefix[i] = 1
        } else {
            // Otherwise, multiply nums[i-1] times the prefix at position i-1,
            // and add that to the prefix array at position i
            prefix[i] = nums[i-1] * prefix[i-1]
        }
    }
    
    // Then, let's create a suffix array
    const suffix = []
    
    // Move right in the input array
    for (let i=nums.length - 1; i>=0; i--) {
        // For the last index, we have no suffix, so just add a 1 to that position
        if (i===nums.length - 1) {
            suffix[i] = 1
        } else {
            // Otherwise, we multiply nums[i+1] by the suffix at position i+1
            // and add that to the suffix array at position i
            suffix[i] = nums[i + 1] * suffix[i + 1]
        }
    }
    
    // Finally, our result array should be the products of prefix * suffix for each position
    const result = []
    
    for (let i=0; i<nums.length; i++) {
        result[i] = prefix[i] * suffix[i]
    }
    
    return result
};
